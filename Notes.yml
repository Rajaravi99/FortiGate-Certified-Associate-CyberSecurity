FortiGate : It is a next generation fiewall (NGFW) which delivers industry leading enterprise security with threat detection and visibility.

Key FortiGate Features: Firewall Authentication both local and remote, VPNs, Security Scanning, Web filters, Monitoring and logging.

FortiGate Advanced Features : SD-WAN (Software Defined - Wide area Network), Virtual Domains (VDOMS), Automation stiches

VLANs : Allows you to split your physical LAN to multiple virtual LANs, each LAN performing a different set of duties. VLANs operat on Layer 3 of Internet Protocol.

Fortigate Offers several ways to configure the VLAN according to the mode in which it is operating, the various modes are:
1. NAT mode
2. Trabsparent mode
3. Virtual VLAN switch (on supported models)

A DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration parameters (subnet mask, default gateway, DNS) to devices on a network.
It uses a pool of IP addresses to lease, renew, or reassign addresses, reducing manual configuration errors and management overhead.

Most basic routing is static routing, the default route sends the data packet if it does not fiend any suitable destination in the network.

Monitoring Static Routes
• The static routes that you create are part of the configuration until you delete them.
• The list of all the configured routes is available in the GUI at Network > Static Routes.
• Creating a static route does not ensure that FortiGate will use that static route to forward traffic.
Several reasons may prevent a route from being added to the routing table:
The route is misconfigured.
The port associated with the
route is down or disabled.
There is a better route to use to forward traffic to that destination.

Firewall policies are sets of rules that you use to control whether traffic in your network is accepted by FortiGate and, if it is accepted, how FortiGate processes it.
While configuring a firewall policy you must select between 2 inspection modes :- Flow based and proxy based.

Threr are 2 types of firewall authentication methods local authentication and remote authentication.

Using SSL Inspection :
HTTPS offers protection by applying encryption to web traffic; however, it also introduces a potential security risk because attackers may attempt to use encrypted traffic to get around your network's normal defenses.

Types of SSL ispections : Certificate Inspection and Deep inspection.
Certificate Inspection
• Inspects the SSL/TLS handshake.
• Verifies the identity of the web server.
• Used only with web filtering.

Deep inspection
• Decrypts incoming traffic to inspect it.
• If safe, re-encrypts the traffic and sends it to the recipient.
• Used with all types of security scanning.

To use FortiGate SSL inspection, you apply an SSL inspection profile to the firewall policy.

Once we add a deep inspection we get certificate warning every time we try to use the website or webapp.

To avoid certificate warnings, do one of the following:
Download the Fortinet Certificate : Download the Fortinet_CA_SSL certificate and install it on all the workstations as a trusted root authority.
Use a CA-Issued SSL Certificate : In the certificate, the basic constraints field must be set to CA:TRUE and the keyUsage field must be set to keyCertSign
