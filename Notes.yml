A DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration parameters (subnet mask, default gateway, DNS) to devices on a network.
It uses a pool of IP addresses to lease, renew, or reassign addresses, reducing manual configuration errors and management overhead.

Most basic routing is static routing, the default route sends the data packet if it does not fiend any suitable destination in the network.

Monitoring Static Routes
• The static routes that you create are part of the configuration until you delete them.
• The list of all the configured routes is available in the GUI at Network > Static Routes.
• Creating a static route does not ensure that FortiGate will use that static route to forward traffic.
Several reasons may prevent a route from being added to the routing table:
The route is misconfigured.
The port associated with the
route is down or disabled.
There is a better route to use to forward traffic to that destination.
