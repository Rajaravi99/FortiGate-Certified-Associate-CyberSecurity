FortiGate : It is a next generation fiewall (NGFW) which delivers industry leading enterprise security with threat detection and visibility.

Key FortiGate Features: Firewall Authentication both local and remote, VPNs, Security Scanning, Web filters, Monitoring and logging.

FortiGate Advanced Features : SD-WAN (Software Defined - Wide area Network), Virtual Domains (VDOMS), Automation stiches

VLANs : Allows you to split your physical LAN to multiple virtual LANs, each LAN performing a different set of duties. VLANs operat on Layer 3 of Internet Protocol.

Fortigate Offers several ways to configure the VLAN according to the mode in which it is operating, the various modes are:
1. NAT mode
2. Trabsparent mode
3. Virtual VLAN switch (on supported models)

A DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration parameters (subnet mask, default gateway, DNS) to devices on a network.
It uses a pool of IP addresses to lease, renew, or reassign addresses, reducing manual configuration errors and management overhead.

Most basic routing is static routing, the default route sends the data packet if it does not fiend any suitable destination in the network.

Monitoring Static Routes
• The static routes that you create are part of the configuration until you delete them.
• The list of all the configured routes is available in the GUI at Network > Static Routes.
• Creating a static route does not ensure that FortiGate will use that static route to forward traffic.
Several reasons may prevent a route from being added to the routing table:
The route is misconfigured.
The port associated with the
route is down or disabled.
There is a better route to use to forward traffic to that destination.

Firewall policies are sets of rules that you use to control whether traffic in your network is accepted by FortiGate and, if it is accepted, how FortiGate processes it.
While configuring a firewall policy you must select between 2 inspection modes :- Flow based and proxy based.

Threr are 2 types of firewall authentication methods local authentication and remote authentication.

Using SSL Inspection :
HTTPS offers protection by applying encryption to web traffic; however, it also introduces a potential security risk because attackers may attempt to use encrypted traffic to get around your network's normal defenses.

Types of SSL ispections : Certificate Inspection and Deep inspection.
Certificate Inspection
• Inspects the SSL/TLS handshake.
• Verifies the identity of the web server.
• Used only with web filtering.

Deep inspection
• Decrypts incoming traffic to inspect it.
• If safe, re-encrypts the traffic and sends it to the recipient.
• Used with all types of security scanning.

To use FortiGate SSL inspection, you apply an SSL inspection profile to the firewall policy.

Once we add a deep inspection we get certificate warning every time we try to use the website or webapp.

To avoid certificate warnings, do one of the following:
Download the Fortinet Certificate : Download the Fortinet_CA_SSL certificate and install it on all the workstations as a trusted root authority.
Use a CA-Issued SSL Certificate : In the certificate, the basic constraints field must be set to CA:TRUE and the keyUsage field must be set to keyCertSign

FortiGate stores malware hashes in its database to constantly keep looking for malware.

FortiGuard Labs provides a database of signatures that allow FortiGate to identify malware.
FortiGate updates can be scheduled on regular intervals to keep the database up-to- date.
This maintains protection against the latest malware variants and previously unknown threats.

Fortigate Antivirus scanning are of 3 types:-
1. Antivirus Scan : Detects viruses which are an excat match with the signatures stored in the fortigate antivirus database.
2. Greyware Scan : Fortigate detects Greyware using a signatures which are not excat malwares.
3. ML / AI Scan : Detects virus/malware which do not have any signatures stored in the database, using it does increase the chances of False Positives.

FortiGate Web Filtering:- For Web filtering Fortigate Uses URL category database.

The action for web filtering is based on the category in which that specific URL is present in the database.
The action taken can be 1 of the following : Allow, Block, Monitor, Warning, Authenticate

An IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) can detect and block malicious network activity by analyzing the traffic and identifying and blocking potential threats.
The fortigate IPS engine uses IPS sensors to detect Malicious traffic, IPS sensors use Protocol decoders and signatures to detect malicious traffic.

Best Practices for IPS : These are some of the best practices to follow when working with an IPS. Click each tile to learn more.
                        Verify that the IPS database is up to date.
                        Consider using the IPS sensors provided as initial templates for new custom ones.
                        Consider using the IPS both for incoming and outgoing traffic.
                        Ensure that SSL inspection is in place so that the IPS can examine all traffic.
                        Evaluate whether you need to tune your IPS sensors.

Functions of Application Control : Can identify network traffic generated by specific applications, and take the appropriate actions, such as: Monitoring, Blocking, Applying traffic shaping
The need of application control may not be useful in static client server architecture but it is becoming more and more important in peer to peer architecture, where many users need to send requests to multiple servers using dynamic ports.

Features of IPsec VPNs : -
  Data Authentication : To verify the source of the data.
  Data Integrity : To prevent data tampering
  Data Confidentiality : To encrypt the traffic
  Anti-replay Protection: To prevent replay attacks

Types of VPNs : Remote access VPNs, site to site VPNs
In both types of VPNs, after the connection is established, the devices in one network can reach the devices in the other network. When connected through a VPN, devices in different networks become part of the same logical network.
The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol is used to create VPN tunnel dynamically (IKEv1 and IKEv2).

Secure Socket Layer VPN : It is a type of VPN that uses SSL encryption to create a secure and encrypted connection between a client device and a device acting as a VPN server.
Benefits of Using SSL VPN :
  1.Use of common protocol HTTP/HTTPS
  2. Flexibility for client access
  3. Granular access to resources
  4. Integrity checks for Windows clients
  5. Cost effective.

SSL VPN functionality has 2 modes : Web Mode and Tunnel mode
Web Mode : Acces the URL like a website.
Tunnel Mode : Provides full access to the server or application as if you are physically present in the network.

Functions of FortiGate System Maintenance :
